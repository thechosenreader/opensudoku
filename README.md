# Open Sudoku

This is a fork of [this repository](https://github.com/ogarcia/opensudoku) authored by [Óscar García Amor](https://ogarcia.me/).

I have:
* integrated [QQWing](https://github.com/stephenostermiller/qqwing), created by Stephen Ostermiller, into the application to allow for offline generation of sudoku puzzles.

[Open Sudoku](https://opensudoku.moire.org/) is a simple open-source Sudoku game.
It's designed to be controlled both by finger and keyboard.
It's preloaded with 90 puzzles in 3 difficulty levels.
More puzzles can be downl./oaded from the web, and it also allows you to enter your own puzzles.
